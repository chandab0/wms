                    <h2>Prof. Philip Kotler</h2>
                    <h3>HR at CodeMogul</h3>
                    <p>An American marketing author, consultant, and professor; currently the S. C. Johnson Distinguished Professor
                        of International Marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He is
                        the author of over 60 marketing books, including Marketing Management, Principles of Marketing, Kotler
                        on Marketing, Marketing Insights from A to Z, Marketing 4.0, Marketing Places, Marketing of Nations,
                        Chaotics, Market Your Way to Growth, Winning Global Markets, Strategic Marketing for Health Care
                        Organizations, Social Marketing, Up and Out of Poverty, and Winning at Innovation. Kotler describes
                        strategic marketing as serving as “the link between society’s needs and its pattern of industrial
                        response.”[1]

                        <br>
                        <br> Kotler helped create the field of social marketing that focuses on helping individuals and groups
                        modify their behaviors toward healthier and safer living styles.

                        <br>
                        <br>Kotler’s latest work focuses on economic justice and the shortcomings of capitalism. He published
                        Confronting Capitalism: Real Solutions for a Troubled Economic System in 2015 and Democracy in Decline
                        Rebuilding its Future in 2016. </p>
